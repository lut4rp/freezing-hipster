As per the road map to World Domination, the Universe has come together and handed me this totally brilliant opportunity to be a part of <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com">Google Summer of Code 2009</a>. After much jubilation and happiness, I figured I have a responsibility to thank some very special people who helped me reach this point, and here they are in no apparent order :-)

- my mum and dad (and perhaps, sister) for raging an unending battle against my obsession for everything geek. And in process, pushing me to my limits :-)
- dear friend, co-drupal-evangelist, co-contributor, co-have-phun-everywhere <a href="http://myzonelabs.com">Gurpartap</a>, who has been a major source of inspiration in my contributions to <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>.
- my mentor, <a href="http://taniwhasolutions.com/">Simon Roberts</a> (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/33667">lyricnz</a>), for supporting <a href="http://drupal.org/project/vote_up_down">Vote Up/Down</a> even before I had thought of GSoC.
- countless IRC channel inhabitants from <a href="http://students.iitk.ac.in/navya/index.html">navya</a>, linux-india and drupal for all the pointless talks (which do turn useful at times)

... and a hearty congrats and ^5 to the other 100 awesome participants this year from India. We rock!
