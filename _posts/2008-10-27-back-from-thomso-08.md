I came back home from IIT Roorkee today morning after a really, really tiring Thomso 2008 (their cultural fest). I had an awesome time there,
hanging around the campus and interacting with a whole lot of IIT students (courtesy my best friend Nitish, who is doing his B.Tech. Electronics from there). Its weird because people there seem as dumb as us, when *ahem* they are not :-P

We took the bus to IIT on 23rd evening and it took us freaking 8 hours to reach Roorkee, as people wanted to stop for food/tea/nonsense after
every kilometer. But we did reach in time for the Battle Of Bands event (Hindi group rock) in which I had to participate, just to find out we were number 25 on the list :o Lots of bands there were simply awesome and had really good original compositions. We band members barely slept the first 48 hours, the result of which was that I slept most of the day on Friday. Apart from that, the campus was very beautiful, but it got *brrr* cold in the night. We stayed at Govind Bhawan (which is the largest boys hostel). I came to know that a particular boys hostel called the Jawahar Bhawan is the most demanded one, since it sits smack in front of one of the girls hostel ;-)

Overall, I'd say the event was ok. Not really good, but yeah, fine. There were problems with the management, some with the audio systems, some popular events clashed with each other leading to confusion. Of course, its understandable that the campus and fest were spread out over a large area, but there could have been better efforts. In fact, even the IIT students agreed that it wasn't up to the mark, Thomso '07 was better. 

I had a fun time anyway (good break to leave my sucked college behind!) though I did miss a couple of people from college. Prestorika was simply awesome on the last day during the English rock event (Wargasm). They covered Metallica, Iron Maiden and Megadeath, and their own track 'Not My Way'. As always, its fun being a part of a large mix of people and forget we have to go back to our own lives as well... sheesh!
