Google Trends and Google Insights are two Google sites, which I personally feel, use the massive Google database for a very interesting purpose. Even though Google is very careful about its privacy policy and all (after all, they don't want a Gmail-privacy-issue retake), what I recently noticed is interesting...  

A <a href="http://ca.biz.yahoo.com/ibd/080807/tech.html?.v=1">Gartner report</a> recently said that the Linux market share was _not_ 1% after all! Its reportedely around 4%. Now, this was a sudden source of joy to many Linux users and this article was 'dugg' some 600 times...
But.
If we do a <a href="http://google.com/trends?q=linux%2C+windows%2C+mac">comparison of Linux, Windows and Mac on Google Trends</a>, we find that the trend for Linux searches in heading downward. Now, before anybody jumps to conclusion, let me make it clear these are just "search trends". As I can think of, this can be because:
- People know more of Linux, and need to search less on it now.
- People search for specific 'distros' instead, like Ubuntu or Fedora etc. as compared to 'linux' itself.

Maybe this shows nothing, or maybe something. But, then that's the fun, isn't it? Just my 2 bytes!
