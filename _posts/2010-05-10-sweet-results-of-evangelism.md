I got this e-mail a week ago...
<blockquote>
Hi,

My name is Sandeep Soni.I had been to IIT kanpur this year during the
Techkriti Festival where I attended the FOSSkriti seminars.

I distinguishably remember the seminar (or rather an informal
informative session) on Google Summer of Code that you delivered.

Inspired by your own experience about GSoC and open source
development, I applied for GSoC this year and fortunately have cleared
the first hurdle of getting selected. I will be working on the project
titled "Development of GIMPLE FE" under GCC organization mentored by
Diego Novillo for the Summer.

I have to thank you for giving that invaluable talk.I sincerely tried
to follow all the advice that you gave in that talk and am happy to
have been inducted into Summer of Code.I also mentioned your name in
the field about the source from which I first came to know about GSoC.
Although Its been only a week now into the schedule and I have not
even started coding, I have already begun to sense why you have been
so passionate about GSoC and Open source Development.I hope that the
coming days be fruitful and successful for me as they must have been
for you.

Thanks.

Cheers
Sandy

Very frankly, I don't remember Sandeep from the crowd. But what this has made him achieve, makes me very very proud. Even though I did not get through GSoC 2010, I consider this as an equivalent success. Best of luck, Sandeep!
