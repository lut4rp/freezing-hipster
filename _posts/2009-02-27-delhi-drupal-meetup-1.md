Announcing the first edition of the great Delhi Drupal Meetup! DDM1 will be held on 1st March 2009 at IIT Delhi (Block II, LT1) 1PM onwards. This isn't going to be a beginner meetup, we're going to try and hack some code (module or a theme). We even have prizes for best on-the-spot module and theme!
<strong>Please carry your laptop with a Drupal development environment with you.</strong>

For all the other details, and to sign up for the meetup, visit http://www.lug-iitd.org/Delhi_Drupal_Meetup
See ya there!
