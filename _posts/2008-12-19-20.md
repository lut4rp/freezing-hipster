Totally against my expectations, I received many more calls/messages in the middle of the night than I usually do. Now I don't want to attribute this to my obvious popularity so I will attribute it to the Facebook effect :-)

Jokes apart, I was really touched how sympathetic people were when they realized I was actually studying for my algorithm design exam, which happened to be on 18th. And how nicely I was wished by people whose birthdays I (very shamelessly) forget. I will mention here those noble kind and truly AWESOME friends who ritualistically wished me at 0000 hrs. Those who wished me later, bleh to you! (but thanks anyway.)
 - Nitish, my best friend.
 - Eshita, my sister, craziness incarnate.
 - Rishabh, friend extraordinary.
 - Yukti, waaaay too good friend for 10+ years now.
 - Gunjan, unquestionably awesome friend, woke up just to wish me!
 - Richa, Sonal, Stuti â€“ super-friends! geez, I didn't even wish them on their b'days (I'm sorry!)
 - Mili, bus-mate and junior. (whose birthday I knew, but forgot)
 - Prateek - prTk, Ruby fanboy and Human Graphical Machina.
 - Akshay, Paridhi et al. - yaay! Cousins!
