For everyone to take note - if you receive a tinyurl.com link from an IM contact that points to a website called http://viddyho.com please don't open it. It will ask you for your Gtalk user name and password. Once you do that, it smartly IMs all your contacts with tinyurls pointing to viddyho.com. You'll go crazy defending hundreds of questions on why you sent them this link, what it contains etc.

Smart business spam it is, but a total pain. DONT OPEN IT! >:o

[[edit]]
For all those who already did enter their passwords, you'll be forced to change your password by Google, the next time you log in to Gmail. Even if you don't, I suggest you change your password ASAP. As far as the reports are concerned, data has not been compromised by the site.
