Come 12th February, and IIT Kanpur will hold <a href="http://techkriti.org/#/fosskriti">FOSSkriti</a> (under its Techkriti technical festival's banner). As the name quite well puts it, FOSSkriti deals with all Free and Open Source Software. And this time in 2009, we'll see <a href="http://techkriti.org/#/fosskriti-events">workshops and sessions</a> on Mozilla technologies, HTML 5, Sahana, YUI and yes, Drupal!

Me and <a href="http://myzonelabs.com">Gurpartap</a> will be leading a Drupal sprint on 13th February, 10PM onwards, focussed on Drupal 7 Usability. For those who follow the Drupal community, know that a formal D7 usability testing will be conducted at the University of Baltimore, 10 days before Drupalcon DC starts. We hope to help out the Usability team by reviewing and hacking on their patches before the formal testing begins. Also, we will be helping new contributors learn their way around and explain how the Drupal core machinery works :-) After all, even something as awesome as Drupal needs thousands of man-hours of work before it ships!

To participate in the sprint, you need:
<ul>
<li>A computer with any CVS client (*nix people have CVS, Windows has TortoiseCVS)</li>
<li>Some knowledge of PHP and MySQL (more than hello-world ;-)</li>
<li>An interest in Drupal!</li>
<li>Willingness to hack and pursue world domination.</li>
</ul>

We hope the hackathon is a great success and hope you have tons of fun! Do join us if you can!
