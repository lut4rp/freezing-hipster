A couple of weeks ago, <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> introduced a "lighter, faster alternative" called <a href="http://lite.facebook.com/">Facebook Lite</a>. Though initially, it was aimed at users from countries with slow internet connections and marginal broadband penetration (like India :-) they soon realized a lot of people liked the Lite way of working. I agree, Lite is fast and slick, but it doesn't have apps >:) That to me at least was a major switch point.

I was one of those "privileged souls" who had the good fortune to beta test Facebook Lite. So I can switch to Lite if I use the lite.facebook.com URL or use the full thingy if I go to facebook.com. But, ever since Facebook finally rolled out Lite to sections of users across India (dunno if they did so elsewhere as well), the users who accepted the "Try Facebook Lite" message can *NOT* go back.

People (including my sister and hordes from college :-p) have tried to manually change the URL to facebook.com, tried to check account settings, tried flaming the Lite fan page (see below), tried doing everything plainly possible without any avail. Tried logging in again but it just redirects to lite.facebook.com. Oh, and no official word from Facebook on this yet. Are you listening, Facebook?
