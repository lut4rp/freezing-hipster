So, this Diwali, I have finally gifted myself an identity, www.pratul.in
This was prompted, because it was getting tiresome telling people about my site,
AND because I will finally test my design and Drupal skills
AND because I want to reign the Google search results on my name
AND because it sounds cool?!

Now its just a matter of time, before I finally shift (permanently) to pratul.in
Yeah!
