I had this wallpaper for long, and it was getting kinda boring seeing just the Druplicon everytime I logged in. Now, another day, I saw this Drupal t-shirt available on some online store (dunno which, will add link if I remember) with the text "Drupal makes me hAPI".
Now that's serious Drupal love! So, I got out GIMP, chose a font (this one's called Augie) and 10 minutes later had this wallpaper done. I find it awesome, so here it is for everyone.
