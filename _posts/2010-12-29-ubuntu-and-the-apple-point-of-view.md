Last week, there was a meet-up of FOSS enthusiasts in and around NCR. It was a rare thing because it takes a lot of motivation for us lazy bums to actually get up and go somewhere. The issue I usually have during these meets is that I don't get to see anything productive being done. I just go to meet people. Talk is boring and I do that enough on IRC and mailing lists.

Since it had been some time since I had met the Delhi folks, I thought I'd attend the meet. These meets are always fun as some flame-war or the other crops up and everyone has a gala time. What's a good meet-up without showing passion and dedication towards your favorite projects anyway? :-) However, something very wrong happened during this meet. It wasn't intentional. But I have to clarify the situation.

There was a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gauravpaliwal/debianvsubuntu">presentation by Gaurav Paliwal</a> on Debian vs Ubuntu and why you should pick Debian over Ubuntu. I've been associated with Ubuntu for a very long time now. I started using Ubuntu when it was a nascent project (in 2006) and I was a passionate (severe and extremist would also do here) evangelist of the system. Ubuntu was doing something that no distribution had ever done before. It was bringing Linux to the masses. I was a part of those "masses" too. I supported them and I was proud to be a tiny part of the movement.

I continued using Ubuntu till late 2008 and then switched to OS X. Why? For one, I needed a new laptop and the MacBook Pro at that time was the best machine in the market. Sure, it was also 20% more expensive than the other brands but the difference in quality was <em>shocking</em>. Now, at that time I never thought I'd actually use OS X. In fact, people from the linux-india IRC channel will remember my continuous rants against OS X for a week or so :P (I bet I still have the logs lying somewhere). But over time, I found that I worked better on OS X than on Ubuntu. Every application that I used on Ubuntu was available on OS X anyway — Firefox, Emacs, a terminal emulator, the Apache/PHP/MySQL stack. MacPorts helped with projects that weren't already bundled with OS X. All in all, it meant a better work experience for me. A win-win situation.

Gaurav's talk, though correct on some places, gave quite odd and IMO, incorrect reasons to shift from Ubuntu to Debian. Reasons like "Debian calls itself GNU/Linux and not Linux" is not going to get any serious Ubuntu user to move. This is an OS change we're talking about. It's like moving homes, it takes a long time to get adjusted to the new environment. Unless there is a problem, people will not move. You wouldn't either. 

Among all the Ubuntu-Debian bashing that was happening, I decided to explain my point of view of why I've been quite unhappy with the Ubuntu project over the past year. The crux of that point is — Ubuntu is trying to be OS X. In fact, it isn't trying anymore, they're simply copying over the experience. Now that may not be a bad thing in some cases, but here, it's an open project we're talking about. I agree OS X provides an excellent user experience in a lot of cases but <em>copying</em> it is pointless! Apple is not the pinnacle of interface design. We can do better. There's lots of places where OS X can be improved. We can learn from them and build a much better system. Hell, even Windows 7 gets some things right that I'd like to see in OS X now.

However, Apple is not Canonical. Apple makes it very clear that they are a vanity product company. Most of their products are targeted at the higher price market. If you want that design and experience, you pay for it. Design is expensive and design sells <em>very easily</em>. BUT, it is also much harder to do. I'll even say it is easier to write good code than it is to do good design. This point got taken in the very VERY wrong manner. There is a difference between saying "Apple makes vanity products" and "Linux is for poor people". I'm shocked that some people actually thought that I'd do the fallacy of meaning the latter. No, that's <em>absolutely</em> wrong. I never EVER meant that, even for a second.

So where did I go wrong? I was very aggressive. I now realize that. I was quite loud and brash. I'm sorry for that. Why did I do that? Again, because Ubuntu as a project is (was?) so dear to me, I feel sorry when I look at it now. I feel worse when I see the stupidities they are doing that makes it so hard to contribute to Canonical-controlled projects (example: notify-osd). I guess I let out that pent up anger and frustration in a very wrong manner. Coupled with a totally different statement I was making, it got taken in the very wrong way.

I hope this makes my point clear now. I never intended to hurt anyone or try and act all cool and impressive. I'll try and keep those "feelings" under control the next time. And I sincerely hope we'll forget what happened and move on to doing actual work :-)
