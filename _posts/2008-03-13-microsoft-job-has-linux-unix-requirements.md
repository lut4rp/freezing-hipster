Microsoft job has Unix/Linux requirements! And will you believe it... This is for Hotmail and Live infrastructure production servers!
This has to be seen to be believed, really... I got this link from someone (sorry I dont remember who) on the ##linux-india IRC channel. It points to the Microsoft Careers website. Read closely and you will notice. I could not digg the original story because the URL was "redirecting in an unfriendly way".

I am not exactly sure what this job is actually all about. Lots of 'big' words are being thrown around. I say, the way M$ people write these ads, you might as well believe your cubicle's gonna be on Neptune! But hey, then again I am not really into deciphering micro$oft jargon :)
