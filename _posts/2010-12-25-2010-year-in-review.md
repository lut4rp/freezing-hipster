Starting my twenty third year of existence on this planet, I'm looking back at the twenty two years that I've spent here as just another life-form. This post has nothing to do with anything. Do not read any further unless you're wearing socks of different colors. I'm just going to rant.

The very start of the year was quite active. Me and <a href="http://blog.uncool.in/">GeneralMaximus</a> were still pretty much working full time on <a href="http://github.com/goonj/goonj">Goonj</a> till February. Yes, it was a failed attempt. Yes, it didn't do any good to the world. Yes, we didn't achieve world domination either. But it did do a lot of good to me. I had a chance of trying out something other than Drupal/PHP and I did. It also totally confirmed to me that GeneralMaximus and me are a great team. We have a superior understanding, we think along the same lines and it's fun to work with him. And he's the co-founder I was looking for :-)

Then, came DrupalCon San Francisco. I can't in words properly describe the pure awesomeness that DrupalCon is. In all the events I've visited, nothing, I repeat, nothing comes close to DrupalCon. Paris was great but SF was in a different league. 3000 people, the most famous conference venue on the planet, geek city - everything was great! I had a lot of fun (and a lot of trouble following work on some of the core patches :P). Also, the git migration team finally got it's thing together and Drupal should finish migrating soon!

That's it, most of the good stuff ends here.

My final semester exams went fairly well. At least I thought they went well. MDU thinks otherwise. Or maybe they don't think at all. I think the university has been running on pure randomness for 30 years. Out of one such randomness, it turned out that more than half the CS batch had failed in either Distributed Operating Systems or Advanced Java. Yeah, you read that right. We actually do have a <em>final</em> semester subject called "Advanced" Java. FML. So, after it was clear that half of us were not going to graduate in 4 years after all, people moved on to try and snatch whatever job they could. I moved to IITK for some pretty interesting work with the Agropedia project.

"Personal" life tried very hard to be the saddest aspect of it all. A year of constant swaying this way and that way... eventually, we just got off the swing. Let's find other people to play with. Let's decide our priorities, choose our destiny, build our lives. They say it's bad when you don't get a "yes!" but I will assure you, it is worse to lose a friend. Never again.

My decision to pursue higher studies was one that oscillated between a yes and a no more than anything else. I had never been this confused! I thought I'd charted it all out, I knew where my life was going. Hell, "I'm in control" and all that. How wrong I was... how very wrong. First, I thought I'd do an MS from the US, which morphed into "Nah, let's do an M.Tech. from India" which re-morphed into "Hm, I'm no use at masters level CS, I could study design instead". Just to make it clear, I always had a sincere interest in design, something that comes naturally to me from mom. I've never been told I'm a good programmer, but a lot of people have told me I have an eye for design. Well, that's that I guess. I (still am) preparing for an M.Des. after all. Finally!

Shaastra 2010 was one of the last really nice things to happen. I met the most awesome bunch of people, made some friends I would not part with till the end of the Universe, had a change of thoughts in many things. There's a <a href="node/74/">separate post</a> for Shaastra anyway, no point talking about it again.

That's it. 2010 for me. A lot of indecisiveness. A lot of stupid decisions. Places where I've felt I shouldn't have said/done many things. Decisions I should have taken the other way. If I look at it positively, I say to myself "that's a lot of learning for a year". Maybe it is. Another year awaits, another set of 365 days to mess life up and learn :-)
