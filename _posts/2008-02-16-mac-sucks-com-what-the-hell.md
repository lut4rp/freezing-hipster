This site is dated around 2003 (time of the G4 and G5) yet I am surprised no ones noticed it yet. It sucks big time... I am surprised its still online! Digg this one, fellow Mac lovers and bring it down!

Here's the URL to the digg page:

(Yeah, I know I might be exaggerating according to some people, but then, I am a Mac user myself. Cant help but be selfish :) But truly true... Vista sucks BIG time in front of Leopard. And that is after I have been using Vista Ultimate for over a year now.)
